    <h1>Toast Sandwich</h1>
    <img src="../pics/toast-sandwich1.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A great Victorian recipe. A toast sandwich is a sandwich made with two slices of bread in which the filling is a thin slice of toasted bread,
    which may be heavily buttered. An 1861 recipe says to add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
    <p>This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any
    of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid.</p>
